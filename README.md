# BouncyBallsJS

In this project I am experimenting with elastic collision in javascript. 

# Main Goals

## Create a confined box as an environment
## Add earth acceleration
## Implement elastic collision
## Combine the implementation of camera motion detection and elestic collistion (allow the user to interact with the balls in the box)
